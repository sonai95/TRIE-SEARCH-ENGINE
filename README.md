# TRIE-SEARCH-ENGINE
Search Engine Development using TRIE Data Structure
The project is about developing a Search Engine portal using TRIE data structure. TRIE is used because of its efficiency to autocomplete. Apart from this TRIE also ensure optimum performance in terms of time complexity.
Words are extracted from a sentence in the form of tokens and stored in the TRIE data Structure. As a search corresponding to a word is made an autocomplete process starts and fetches all probable results on the basis of number of clicks made on that link.
Sentences along with their links and the number of clicks made are stored in a Mysql database. For database management we have made use of JDBC throgh which we can directly access and manipulate our database items. At last, the whole application is run on GlassFish server using JSP.
